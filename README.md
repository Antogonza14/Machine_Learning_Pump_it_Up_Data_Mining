## Project Overview

This project is part of the **"Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table"** competition hosted on DrivenData. The objective is to predict the operational status of water points in Tanzania using a dataset with features that include location, operational details, and water quality indicators.

---

## Dataset

Access the dataset on [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/).

---

## Problem Statement

Classify each water point into:
1. **Functional**
2. **Needs Repair**
3. **Non-functional**

Challenges include:
- Imbalanced classes
- Missing data
- High cardinality in categorical variables

---

## Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Impute missing values
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Scale numerical features

2. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Algorithms: Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall

3. **Submission**:
   - Format predictions as required by DrivenData (two columns: pump IDs and status).

---

## Results

Achieved **[Your Score]** on the leaderboard.
